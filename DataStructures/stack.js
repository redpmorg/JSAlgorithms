/**
 * A Stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements,
 * with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection,
 * and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
 * The order in which elements come off a Stack gives rise to its alternative name,
 * LIFO (for last in, first out).
 *
 * Complexity: Average
 * Access	Search	Insertion	Deletion
 *  O(n)	 O(n)	  O(1)	     O(1)
